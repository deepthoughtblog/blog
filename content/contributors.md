Deep Thought is driven by its community. We're open to publish articles from contributors as long as they follow the principles explained above.
To maintain the quality, all articles go through a review process via GitHub [pull requests](https://github.com/deepthoughtblog/blog/pulls).
There are designated editors for these articles who have a final say on acceptance -- and the process is totally transparent via these pull request reviews.

Read the **[contributing guide](https://github.com/deepthoughtblog/blog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)** to get started.
