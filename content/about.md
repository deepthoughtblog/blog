When building, maintaining and managing software, there are so many patterns, opinions and ways to achieve something. Since there are many sources for such information and search engines have made them easy to find, developers have a difficult time figuring out which solution to proceed with. At times, the solution might look impressive, but might not scale well. Some solutions might not be maintainable in the long run. This begs the question, _how does one decide?_

<span class="newthought">Deep Thought is a collection of</span> well researched ideas and practices in software engineering and computer science that have stood the test of time. We bring you these ideas in form of articles, papers and podcasts. When understood deeply and followed consistently over time, these ideas and practices will help you make better decisions as a developer, avoid technical debt and write resilient software in the long run.
